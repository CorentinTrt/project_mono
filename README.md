# Mono

Mono is a project born to train myself on general back-end development, general project supervision, monorepo management and Opentelemetry.

I will also leverage the complexity of a monorepo to have a "real" usecase to improve in Cloud Architecture and help me get the Google Cloud Architect certification.

#### WIP - This project is nowhere near finish and will evolve in the future.

## Usage

```sh
$ nx serve <app_name>
# to run an application in development mode
```

```sh
$ nx build <name>
# to build an application or a library
```

```sh
$ nx graph
# to show a graph that represent how application and libraries depends on each other
```

```sh
$ nx reset
# to recreate the dependency graph if you broke it in some way
```
